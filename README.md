###colors
Color selection is an important part of any design process; however, in this case it becomes even more important due to the potential negative effects on the end user.

###fonts

It was important to consider the font when designing the landing page for a positive user experience. An import code within the style.css file uses Google Fonts to implement the Roboto sans-serif font for the project.

A friendly and easy-to-read font, Roboto





### Wireframes

Adobe XD was used to create the desktop wireframe, and Photoshop was used for the mobile version due to time constraints.

###bootstrap-cards




###footer



###responsive-design



A responsive implementation was achieved using the Bootstrap Framework without the need for additional CSS or media queries.

Using frameworks has proven to be a very valuable learning experience. By debugging within Dev Tools to identify and resolve responsiveness issues, I believe I now have a much better understanding of how to incorporate Bootstrap into future projects.



###built-with


###deployment

A Code Institute Template was used to create this GitHub project, which ensured all dependencies were included when the project was opened within the Gitopod IDE's workspace.



###testing

As a result of time constraints, I was unable to fix the CSS file bugs, but the styles on the page are unaffected.
